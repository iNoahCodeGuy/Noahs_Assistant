"""Generation pipeline nodes - LLM response creation and hallucination prevention.

This module handles answer generation with the LLM:
1. generate_draft → LLM creates answer using retrieved context
2. hallucination_check → Attaches citations and flags hallucination risk

Design Principles:
- SRP: Each function handles one generation concern
- Runtime awareness: Technical users see self-referential architecture content
- Defensibility: Graceful degradation on LLM failures
- Observability: Detailed logging for generation quality

Performance Characteristics:
- generate_draft: ~800-1500ms (LLM call)
- hallucination_check: <10ms (in-memory citation attachment)

See: docs/context/CONVERSATION_PERSONALITY.md for generation personality

    This is where the LLM creates the actual answer to the user's question.
    It uses the chunks we retrieved in the previous step as context.

    Special cases:
    - For data display requests, we skip LLM generation and fetch live analytics
    - For vague queries with insufficient context, we provide a helpful fallback

    Runtime awareness (Software Developer role only):
    - Architecture queries → Show conversation flow or full stack diagrams
    - Performance queries → Show metrics table
    - Code queries → Show actual retrieval implementation
    - SQL queries → Show pgvector query example
    - Cost queries → Show cost analysis table
    - Scaling queries → Show enterprise scaling strategy

    Design Principles:
    - **SRP**: Only generates answer, doesn't retrieve or log
